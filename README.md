<p style="float:right">The Simon Game is a classic electronic game of memory skill. The game presents a series of colored buttons and plays a sequence, which the player must then repeat by clicking the buttons in the same order. With each successful round, the sequence becomes longer and more complex. The goal is to see how many rounds the player can successfully complete without making a mistake. This web version of the Simon Game faithfully recreates the nostalgic experience of the original while adding a modern touch with its HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery implementation. </p>
