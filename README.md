The Simon Game is a classic electronic game of memory skill. 🤔 <br>
The game presents a series of colored buttons and plays a sequence, which the player must then repeat by clicking the buttons in the same order. <br>
With each successful round, the sequence becomes longer and more complex. 😮‍💨 <br>
The goal is to see how many rounds the player can successfully complete without making a mistake. 😉 <br>
This web version of the Simon Game faithfully recreates the nostalgic experience of the original while adding a modern touch with its HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery implementation.
